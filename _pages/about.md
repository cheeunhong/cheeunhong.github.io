I am passionate about advancing **efficient AI** to optimize both model training and inference, with the ultimate goal of promoting sustainable AI. My research focuses on developing cutting-edge techniques like **network quantization**, **pruning**, and **test-time adaptation**, aimed at drastically reducing the computational costs while maintaining high performance. While much of my work has targeted efficiency improvements in low-level vision tasks like image restoration, my broader goal is to compress large-scale, computationally intensive models—including vision-language and generative models—to move closer to achieving **on-device AI**. <br>
