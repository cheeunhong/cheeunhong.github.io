Recently, many problems have been solved with deep learning using massive computational sources, often referred to as red AI. On the other hand, I am interested in **green deep learning** that considers energy usage and carbon emissions during model training and inference. Among the various compression technologies to obtain lightweight models, my previous works are mainly focused on **efficient inference** approaches such as **network quantization and pruning**. Specifically, several projects are about **test-time adaptation** of computational resources based on the sensitivity of the input image to compression (i.e., the less sensitive the input is, the fewer computational resources that are allocated). Although my latest projects are on compressing models for **low-level image restoration** problems, my research goal is to compress any deep learning model with massive computations.
