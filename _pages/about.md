Recently, many problems have been solved with deep learning using massive computational sources, often referred to as red AI. On the other hand, I am interested in **green deep learning** that considers energy consumption and carbon emissions during model training and inference. My previous works are mainly focused on developing **efficient inference** techniques, including **network quantization and pruning**, to create lightweight models. I have also explored **test-time adaptation** of computational resources in several projects. Recently, I have been working on lightweight models for **low-level vision** problems, but my broader research goal is to compress any computationally demanding models.
