I am interested in **green deep learning** that considers energy usage and carbon emissions during model training and inference. Among the various lightweight technologies, I mainly focus on **efficient inference** approaches such as **network quantization and pruning**. While my interest is in compressing any deep learning model with massive computations, my latest projects focus on compressing models for **low-level image restoration** problems.
